# Time-saving Adblock Filters

Time-saving content filter lists for hiding specific contents of web-pages (with Brave, uBlock Origin, Adblock, etc.).

## How to use in Brave browser

Go to "Brave Shields & privacy > Content filters" in the Brave settings, and copy-paste the URL of the raw content of a list file from this repo (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamperritt/timesaving-adblock-filters/refs/heads/main/lists/InstagramAntiDoomScrolling.txt`) into the "Add custom filter list" URL text field, then click "Add".

## Available filter lists

### Instagram Anti-Doom Scrolling

**Raw file URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamperritt/timesaving-adblock-filters/refs/heads/main/lists/InstagramAntiDoomScrolling.txt

This list filters out all Instagram web app content except for Instagram DMs and Stories, helping you reclaim your time and avoid the endless doom scrolling.

For best Instagram app experience on Android and Desktop:
1. In the Brave browser, add the URL for this list as a "custom filter list" (see 'how-to' above)
2. Visit and log in to the Instagram website
3. In the Brave options menu, select the "Add to home screen" option and install
4. Open the newly-installed Instagram PWA from your homescreen and accept the prompt to enable notifications from Instagram
6. In Instagram "Notifications > Push Notifications" settings, turn off all push notifications except for "Messages from individual and group chats".

You'll now have a nicely-functioning version of the Instagram app that lets you stay connected with your friends without all the time-wasting content.
